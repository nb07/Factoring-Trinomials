# Factoring-Trinomials
This is a program I wrote to solve trinomials! It can only solve trinomals of type ax^2 + bx + c where a = 1. 
Still needs some work but it can factor a mean trinomial!

I Built it to run in Repl.it. When you press run it prompts you to type in three polynomials and the subtractions or additions.

It takes the last number and first number and multiplies them together, then it factors it. 
It tests the sum of the factors until it finds 2 numbers that equal the second polynomial and returns (x + a)(x + b).
